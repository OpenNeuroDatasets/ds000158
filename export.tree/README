Quality Control
---------------
We are having difficulties running MRIQC and have not included the results in this
revision. These should be present in the next revision.

Where to discuss the dataset
----------------------------
1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset
page.
2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX
accession number.
3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the dsXXXXXX accession number 
in
your email.


Known Issues
------------
- The defacing process was quite aggressive for some of the anatomical images, resulting in minor removal of brain. According to the submitter, this is unlikely to have any effect on the BOLD workflow, as the workflow simply registers the mean EPI to the T1.
- The workflow was created when the dataset was in a different organizational format. Since 
the dataset has been converted to BIDS, it needs to be updated.
