The following is taken from the the above website:

"The file TVA_loc.zip contains a set of stimuli to perform in a functional localizer of the 
temporal voice areas (TVA) with fMRI. This functional localizer lasts 10 minutes and is based 
on the contrast of vocal vs. nonvocal sounds (cf. Belin et al, (2000) Nature).
The localizer contains 40 8-sec blocs of sounds (16 bit, mono, 22050 Hz sampling rate): 20 
blocs (vocal_01 -> vocal_20) consist of only vocal sound (speech as well as nonspeech), and 
20 consist of only nonvocal sounds (industrial sounds, environmental sounds, as well as some 
animal vocalizations). All sounds have been normalized for RMS; a 1kHz tone of similar energy 
is provided for calibration.
The file TVA_loc.txt provides a proposed order of the sound blocs, optimized for the contrast 
Vocal vs. Nonvocal. Number 1->20 refer to the 20 vocal blocs; number 21->40 refer to the 20 
nonvocal blocs; 99 refers to an 8-sec silence bloc.
The localizer has been planned for a TR of 10 sec (sparse sampling), with a dummy scan at the 
beginning (starting the sound stimulation), and a beginning of each block 2 sec after 
beginning of image acquisition. In this case, and following the bloc order suggested in 
TVA_loc.txt, 61 volumes should be acquired, and the vector of onsets for the two conditions 
VOCAL and NONVOCAL are (in seconds):
VOCAL = [22 62 82 112 132 162 202 222 242 262 312 352 372 402 432 462 482 512 542 572];
NONVOCAL= [12 32 52 102 122 142 182 232 282 302 322 342 382 422 442 472 502 522 552 592];
Note: it is also possible to use the localizer with a TR of 2 sec, with a continuous 
scanning noise as background."
